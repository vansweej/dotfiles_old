# Jan's dotfiles

mostly taken from Paul Irish files https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles

Some vim plugins still need some tweaking (like Ultisnip)

Urxvt is setup with transpararant background, use the background in Pictures to show Vims's movement keys.
The background was taken from: http://naleid.com/blog/2010/10/04/vim-movement-shortcuts-wallpaper
